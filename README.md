Merchant Guide to the Galaxy:

Some of the key concepts to my approach are to sse Object Oriented principles to drive the solution. Use 
language used in the problem statement to drive class name's in the solution. To divide the input into transaction types.
For example:
    * Galactic Currency Expression Transaction :- how much is pish tegj glob glob ?
    * Per unit Rare metal value transaction :- glob glob Silver is 34 Credits
    * Total credit evaluation transaction :- how many Credits is glob prok Silver ?
    * Once the Galactic Currency Expression Transaction can be evaluated then it can be re-used 
    to evaluate Per unit Rare metal value transaction and after you have a and b then it can used to evaluate c.
